# Introduction
The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the data science community. It provides information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic, including details such as age, gender, class, fare, and whether they survived the tragic sinking. This dataset is frequently used to practice data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling techniques.
In this exercise, we aim to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset. The primary objectives are to handle missing values, ensure data consistency, and visualize the relationships between various features and survival outcomes.

# Challenges
Handling Missing Data:
The dataset contains missing values in several columns such as age, embarked, deck, and embark_town. Deciding how to handle these missing values is critical for ensuring the integrity of the analysis. Common strategies include imputing missing values with the mean, median, or mode, or filling with placeholders.

Categorical Data:
Columns like sex, embarked, and deck contain categorical data. Ensuring these are correctly encoded and managed for both visualization and further analysis is important. For instance, the deck column needed to be converted to string type to handle missing values properly.

Data Redundancy:
The alive column provides redundant information already contained in the survived column. Identifying and removing such redundancies helps streamline the dataset and avoid confusion.

Data Types:
Ensuring each column has the correct data type is crucial. For example, converting categorical data to string types when necessary ensures proper handling during analysis.

Visualizing Missing Values:
Understanding the extent and pattern of missing values through visualization (e.g., heatmaps) helps in deciding the best strategy to handle them.

Distribution and Outliers:
Analyzing the distribution of numerical features helps in understanding the data's spread and identifying potential outliers. Visualizations such as histograms and box plots are used for this purpose.

Survival Analysis:
Exploring survival rates based on different features such as gender, class, age, and fare requires various visualizations like count plots, bar plots, and box plots. These visualizations help uncover patterns that might be predictive of survival.
